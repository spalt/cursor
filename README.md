Tim Schafer's Caps Lock Cursor App

Sorry it took so long, I fell asleep last night.

Run Cursor.exe to start.

Replace "cursor-capson.cur" with your favorite cursor file to indicate the caps-lock-on state.

Replace "cursor.cur" with the normal, non-caps-lock cursor.

A great place to get cur files is http://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-library
